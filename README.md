president
=========

A card game developed in C++

First edition will just be a command line game played by 2 players
Later functionality will be added to allow online play, graphical
interface, and maybe other features. 
The game is President, aka scum, aka asshole.
The main objective is to be the first to lay down all of your cards

CURRENT STATE:
  The beginning of the TCP communication is completed
  As I am a student the project is going on the back burner for an undetermined amount of time
